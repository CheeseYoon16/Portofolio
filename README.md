# PORTOFOLIO ELIYUN
First of all, hello and welcome to my portofolio!
Mostly it contains of my writing portofolio such as articles, poets, or any kind of writing for some rubric in magazines or bulletin.
I've been a writer most of my life because writing is like an air for me, I breathe words- welp.
Though lately I've been trying to change my path of carreer to work in Game Industry- but still in creative writing area such as Game Designer.
I hope this portofolio of mine will convince how I literally- breathe words.
